This is a simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game for The Odin Project's Foundations course. The game is played via the JS console and input is accepted through user prompts.

 - A prompt window will appear on the page, asking for Rock, Paper, or Scissors. 
 - The user should open the console and then enter their choice into the prompt. 
 - The prompt will remain on the page to enter subsequent choices.
 - Upon submitting a choice, the result of each round will be logged to the console.
 - There are 5 rounds in total. After 5 rounds are played, the result of the game will be logged to the console.

This project is made with HTML and vanilla Javascript.

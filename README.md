This is a simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game for The Odin Project's Foundations course. This branch contains a user interface, unlike the main branch which is played via the console.

 - The user is presented with 3 buttons -- Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
 - The user's and the computer's running scores are displayed at the top and will update after each round played.
 - The result of each round will display next to the buttons.
 - The result of the game will appear below the buttons after the game is over.
 - To play, the user clicks the button of their choice. The computer will then randomly make it's choice, the winner of the round is determined, and the proper score will update.
 - After each round, the user will click the button of their choice again and this cycle repeats until either the user or the computer reaches a score of 5.
 - Once either the user or computer reaches 5 points, the winner is displayed at the bottom.
 - To restart, the page must be reloaded.
